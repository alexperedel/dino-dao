                    Dino DAO is a community of builders, creators, and dreamers. We’re here to shape the future,
                    innovate,
                    and bring ideas to life together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like dinosaurs ruling their era, we move with strength and purpose—pushing boundaries, supporting
                    each
                    other, and making an impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is more than a DAO. It’s a movement. It’s our playground. And we’re just getting started.
